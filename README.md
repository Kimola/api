# Kimola API

Kimola is a research and analysis platform that helps businesses understand customer feedback and market data at scale. The Kimola API provides programmatic access to its core features, making it possible to integrate data collection, analysis, and insights directly into your own applications.

This repository hosts the official documentation for the Kimola API. It includes details about available endpoints, authentication, usage examples, and guidelines for integrating Kimola’s research features into your applications.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Kimola API, you’ll need a Kimola account. A free plan is available at [kimola.com/sign-up](https://kimola.com/sign-up), and some plans include API access by default. After signing in, you can find your package details and API key in the **Account** menu of the dashboard.  

The API is intended to extend your own applications with Kimola’s research and analysis features — not to build a competing service. In other words, you can integrate Kimola’s capabilities into your products or workflows, but creating a product that replicates Kimola itself through the API is not permitted.  

Any application that uses data or analysis results from Kimola must also respect our [Privacy Policy](https://kimola.com/privacy-policy). This ensures that data collected, processed, or displayed through the API is handled responsibly and in line with user expectations.  

If you notice something missing in the documentation or have suggestions to improve it, feel free to [open an issue](../../issues) here on GitHub — contributions and feedback are always welcome.

## Authentication

Requests to endpoints that require authentication must include a valid API key. This ensures that only verified users can access their own data, models, and analysis results. If a request is sent without valid authentication, it will be rejected.  

You can locate your personal API key in the **Account** menu once you are logged into the Kimola dashboard. This page also shows your current subscription plan, so you can check whether API access is included.  

Kimola uses the **Bearer token** method for authentication. In this method, your API key is attached to each request inside the `Authorization` header. The API then validates the token before processing the request. This is a widely adopted standard for securing APIs, as it keeps credentials separate from request parameters and works across any HTTP client.  

Here’s an example request using the Bearer scheme:  

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kimola.com/v1/subscription/usage" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```


When authentication fails, the API returns plaintext error messages with the following HTTP status codes:

| HTTP&nbsp;Status | When it happens? | Response body |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | The `Authorization` header is missing. | `You must provide an authorization header.` |
| 400 | The header exists but does not include a Bearer token (e.g., not in the form `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>`). | `You must provide a Bearer Token (Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>)` |
| 401 | The provided API key is invalid (not recognized). | `The provided API key is invalid.` |
| 403 | The request targets a route that requires a specific `:secret` and the key does not grant access to that secret. | `You are not allowed to access this model.` |


**Notes**

- Authentication is enforced only on endpoints marked as requiring an API key (internally, via an endpoint attribute).
- API keys are validated against Kimola’s key service and are cached for performance; invalid keys will always yield **401**.
- Always include the full Bearer header. Omitting it or sending an incorrect scheme will result in **400**.

## Resources
This section introduces the core resources available in the Kimola API.

**Preset**: Presets are ready-to-use AI models hosted by Kimola that you can call directly—no training required. They power tasks like text classification and entity extraction and are intended to be embedded into your product workflows.  

**Query**: Provides API endpoints to inspect Query consumption in Kimola. Each transaction such as text classification, scraping, or tracking (e.g., retrieving customer feedback from X) consumes from the user’s Query limit.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### POST /presets/{key}/predictions

Run **predictions** on a given text using a specific Preset (Kimola’s pretrained AI model).  
Use this to classify customer feedback or other short texts. When `aspectBased=true`, the API performs **aspect-based classification** (per-topic sentiment) and consumes **2 queries**; otherwise it returns the dominant label and consumes **1 query**.

> **Auth required:** `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>`

#### Path parameters

curl -X POST "https://api.kimola.com/v1/presets/8kq3w1h2f0c7b5m9r2t6y4u1/predictions?language=en&aspectBased=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "\"Really pleased with the quality of the stand mixer. It looks and functions great with loads of optional accessories. I had a couple for questions first but solved via email very easily.\""
```

#### Example aspect-based response (200)
```json
[
  { "name": "Features and Quality", "sentiment": "Positive" },
  { "name": "Customer Service",     "sentiment": "Positive" }
]
```

#### Example standard response (200)
```json
[
  { "name": "Features and Quality", "probability": 0.95 }
